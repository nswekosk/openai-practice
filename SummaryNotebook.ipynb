      "3. Trusted Orchestration Management (TOM) requires a trustworthy mechanism focused on identity, provenance, and orchestration as aspects of a facetted smart contracts approach.\n",
      "4. The proposed architecture pattern for TOM involves an orchestrator, containers, data, and a set of core activities, with all actions recorded in the blockchain to guarantee data provenance and the identity of all entities stored.\n",
      "5. Implementation options for the architecture pattern include Docker Swarm and Kubernetes as container cluster engines, and Hyperledger Fabric as a permissioned blockchain platform.\n",
